1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	- it identified the exact location in which the two differed and made debugging easier

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	- You can see the changes you've made over time and find ways to implement old code to new code if necessary

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	- Pros are that you are in control, cons are that sometimes the user does not utilize the tool well.

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	- It is made to make development easier and track all related changes

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	- git log brings a list of previous commits and git diff allows you to compare two of them and see the changes you've made

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	- You can always go back to a working version

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	- development in general
